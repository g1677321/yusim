# Yusim

Yusim is a simple simulator based on [Disksim](http://www.pdl.cmu.edu/DiskSim/) program. We purposed to invoke two Disksim programs with two sub-processes to implement hybrid storage system.

In current version, we construct two sims(SSDsim and HDDsim) which respectively serves 'only one' request and follow a simple simulation progress(Wait/Serve/Wait/.../Shutdown). After each service, the sim returns a empty request(no other info.) with response time. That is Yusim.

# Feature
## Simulator
*	Follow Disksim simulation included bus, controller and storage device.
*	Hybrid communication between SSD(considered as HDD-cache) and HDD should be concerned.
*	Replaceable caching policy.
*	Replaceable I/O request scheduler.
*	Support multi-user requests and system-defined user weights.
*	Block-level request delivery
*	Various experiment data, e.g., Response time, Throughtput and Hit rate.

## Policy
*	I/O Scheduler: **Credit-based scheduler**.
*	SSD Caching/Replacement Policy: **Prize Caching**.
*	SSD Caching Space: **Logical Partition**.

# Trace Format

1.	***[User_Weight]*** : An `unsigned integer` as "User Weight".
2.	_(Disksim-defined)_ **_[Request_Arrival_Time]_** : `Double`-precision milliseconds.
3.	_(Disksim-defined)_ **_[Device_number]_** : An `unsigned integer` as specified device. Consider multi-disk in one device parameter file(e.g., RAID).
4.	_(Disksim-defined)_ **_[Block_Number]_** : An `unsigned long` as the start of accessed block. Due to address alignment for SSD, it must be a valid number.

5.	_(Disksim-defined)_ **_[Request_Size]_** : An `unsigned integer` as the consecutive length. Due to address alignment for SSD, it must be a valid number.
6.	_(Disksim-defined)_ **_[Request_Flag]_** : **'1'** assigned as "Read" request and **'0'** assigned as "Write" request.
7.	***_[User_Number]_*** :  An `unsigned integer` user number from '1' to 'N'.
